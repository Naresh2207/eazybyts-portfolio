            <h1>Figma Coffee Website</h1>
            <p>
              The Coffee Website project is a responsive, visually appealing
              landing page inspired by a Figma design. It showcases a modern
              layout with sections for featured products, brand story, and
              customer engagement. Built using HTML and CSS, the site reflects a
              clean design structure, smooth user experience, and attention to
              detail in translating a static Figma design into a functional
              webpage.
